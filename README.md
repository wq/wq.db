[wq.db](https://wq.io/wq.db) is a collection of Python modules for building robust, flexible schemas and REST APIs for use in creating field data collection apps and (more generally) mobile-first websites with progressive enhancement.  wq.db is the backend component of [wq] and is geared primarily for use with [wq.app], though it can be used separately.  wq.db is built on the [Django] platform.

#### Support Matrix

wq.db is compatible with Python >= 3.4 and Django >= 1.11.

&nbsp;      | Python | Django | Django REST Framework
------------|--------|--------|-----------------------
**wq.db 1.0** | 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 | 1.8, 1.10, 1.11 | 3.6
**wq.db 1.1** | 2.7*, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 | 1.11, 2.0, 2.1 | 3.9
**wq.db 1.2 (In Development)** | 3.4+ | 1.11, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 | 3.9, 3.10
**wq.db 2.0 (Future)** | 3.5+ | 2.1+ | 3.10

&#42; Python 2.7 support is no longer tested, but is known to work in wq.db 1.1 and earlier.

## Getting Started

```bash

# Recommended: create virtual environment
# python3 -m venv venv
# . venv/bin/activate

# Install entire wq suite (recommended)
pip install wq

# Install only wq.db
pip install wq.db
```

See [the documentation] for more information.

## Features

wq.db provides the following modules:

### [wq.db.rest]
Extends the excellent [Django REST Framework] with a collection of views, serializers, and context processors useful for creating a progresively enhanced website that serves as its own mobile app and [its own REST API].  The core of the library is an admin-like [ModelRouter] that connects REST urls to registered models, and provides a descriptive [configuration object] for consumption by [wq.app's client-side router].  wq.db.rest also includes a GeoJSON serializer/renderer.

### [wq.db.patterns]
A collection of abstract models and serializers for use in constructing advanced [design patterns] including [nested forms], [EAV structures][EAV], and [natural keys].  Includes [wq.db.patterns.identify][identify], an installable Django app module to help manage third-party entity identifers.
